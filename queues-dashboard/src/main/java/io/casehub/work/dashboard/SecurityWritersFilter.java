/**
 * Lambda filter: any document submitted by the security writing team is urgent,
 * regardless of the priority field on the WorkItem.
 *
 * <p>
 * This demonstrates the Lambda CDI filter pattern — business rules that require
 * Java logic rather than an expression string. A document flagged as security-related
 * ({@code candidateGroups} contains {@code "security-writers"}) must always enter the
 * urgent review queue to meet compliance publication timelines, even if submitted with
 * {@code MEDIUM} priority by mistake.
 *
 * <p>
 * Lambda filters are always active while deployed. They are discovered automatically
 * by {@code LambdaFilterRegistry} via CDI {@code Instance<WorkItemFilterBean>}.
