/**
 * Runnable example demonstrating the full queue lifecycle event sequence:
 * {@code ADDED → CHANGED → CHANGED → REMOVED}.
 *
 * <p>
 * This example is specifically designed to make the {@code QueueMembershipTracker}
 * design constraints visible. Each step's explanation shows both what the tracker
 * produces (correct) and what a naïve live-entity snapshot would produce (wrong).
 *
 * <h2>Scenario steps</h2>
 * <ol>
 * <li><strong>Create + label</strong>: WorkItem created (no label yet → not in queue).
 * Then {@code addLabel("lifecycle-demo/case-1")} → filter engine runs →
 * {@code ADDED} fires.</li>
 * <li><strong>Claim</strong>: filter re-evaluates; MANUAL label survives the INFERRED
 * strip → {@code CHANGED} fires.</li>
 * <li><strong>Start</strong>: same re-evaluation; still in queue → {@code CHANGED} fires.</li>
 * <li><strong>Remove label</strong>: {@code removeLabel()} persists the removal, then the
 * filter engine runs with no matching labels → {@code REMOVED} fires.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Why ADDED fires in step 1 (tracker invariant)</h2>
 * <p>
 * {@code WorkItemLifecycleEvent} fires AFTER the WorkItem mutation is persisted. When
 * the observer fetches the entity, the label is already in the store. A naïve live
 * snapshot would see:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   before = {Q}   ← label already present in store when observer fetches entity
 *   after  = {Q}   ← label survives evaluate()
 *   result: CHANGED  ← WRONG — item was just entering the queue for the first time
 * </pre>
 *
 * The tracker correctly returns empty for a new item:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   before = {}    ← no prior history in work_item_queue_membership table
 *   after  = {Q}
 *   result: ADDED  ← correct
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Why REMOVED fires in step 4 (tracker invariant)</h2>
 * <p>
 * Label removal is also persisted before the event fires. A naïve live snapshot sees:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   before = {}    ← label already gone when observer fetches entity
 *   after  = {}    ← no labels → not in queue
 *   result: no event  ← WRONG — item just left a queue it was in
 * </pre>
 *
 * The tracker remembers the post-step-3 membership:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   before = {Q}   ← loaded from work_item_queue_membership table
 *   after  = {}    ← label removed
 *   result: REMOVED  ← correct
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Why CHANGED not REMOVED+ADDED in steps 2–3 (context invariant)</h2>
 * <p>
 * The filter engine strips all INFERRED labels before re-applying them. Without the
 * {@code QueueMembershipContext} before/after boundary, this would emit REMOVED (strip)
 * then ADDED (re-apply) within one operation. The context collapses these into CHANGED
 * by comparing membership only at operation boundaries, not during the strip.
 *
 * <h2>Persistence across restarts</h2>
 * <p>
 * The {@code work_item_queue_membership} table (V2001 migration) stores the tracker state.
 * On JVM restart the tracker reads from DB — items currently in queues produce CHANGED
 * (not a spurious re-ADDED) on their next lifecycle event.
 *
 * <h2>Running</h2>

 *   curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/queue-examples/lifecycle/run | jq .
