/**
 * Well-known relation type constants for {@link WorkItemRelation}.
 *
 * <h2>Extensibility — this is not an enum</h2>
 * <p>
 * Relation types are plain strings stored in the {@code relation_type} column.
 * This class provides named constants for discoverability, but consuming
 * applications can use <em>any non-blank string</em> as a relation type without
 * any schema change, registration, or configuration:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Well-known type — use the constant
 * "PART_OF"
 *
 * // Custom type — just use the string
 * "TRIGGERED_BY"
 * "APPROVED_BY"
 * "ESCALATED_FROM"
 * "RESOLVED_BY"
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Directionality</h2>
 * <p>
 * All relations are directed: {@code source → target}.
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code "child" PART_OF "parent"} — child is a member of the parent group</li>
 * <li>{@code "A" BLOCKS "B"} — A must be resolved before B can proceed</li>
 * <li>{@code "A" RELATES_TO "B"} — bidirectional by convention; store two rows if both
 * directions are needed</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>UI implications</h2>
 * <p>
 * {@link #PART_OF} enables:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Tree navigation — traverse parent and children via REST</li>
 * <li>Group summaries — X of Y children completed</li>
 * <li>Breadcrumb trails — walk PART_OF chain to root</li>
 * <li>"Top-level only" filter — WorkItems with no outgoing PART_OF</li>
 * <li>Epic-style views — one root WorkItem with a child list</li>
 * </ul>
